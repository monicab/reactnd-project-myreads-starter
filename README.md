# MyReads Project

This project has two main parts:
* The main page shows 3 shelves for books, and each book is shown on the correct shelf.
* Search page allows users to find books and move them to different shelves.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* run test `npm test`
* run tests with code `npm test -- --coverage`

## Comments

* Unfortunately not all components have tests
* I added a few comments through the code when I wasn't sure about the
best way to implement it.
